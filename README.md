# FSD Mood Tracker React Project: Part 1

For this weekend you will be creating the full user interface for a mood tracker React application. You will use your knowledge of components and props to create reusable parts in your application.

#### Note:
Refer back to DJ Days React Demo from class for ideas...

## Instructions

In this repository you have a basic pre-made React application that will serve as the foundation to your mood tracking app. You are required to create the following to set up the user interface:

- A component folder to hold all your components
- At least five components to cover the needs of your user interface. How you decide to divide up the parts of your site into components is up to you. Consider our discussion about Atomic Design in class (and check out this resource: https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/atomic-design-principles-methodology-101/)
- At least three examples of using props to customize the content of your components

Your app needs to eventually be able to do the following:
- Provide some sort of input (like a button, dropdown, input field, etc) for a user to mark how they're feeling
- Provide some sort of input (like a button, dropdown, input field, etc) for a user to mark the day they are feeling a specific mood (can be exact date, day of the week, etc)
- Have the components to allow a user to view all of their submissions so far in the mood tracker (such as a list showcasing what they've entered previously)
- Basic elements like a header, etc

## Note: you do NOT have to add the functionality in yet!!!
You just need to focus on creating the user interface

## Recommendations:
There are no specific styling requirements for this project, however we are at a point in the course where you should be able to decide how much you want to add to the layout. This can be a great example project for your portfolio so design it accordingly.

If you are unsure of where to start you can always start by hardcoding HTML elements in *App.js* to get the general layout of what you will need above. Then you can pull apart the pieces and turn them into components.

## Getting Started
Make sure to fork this project into your own Github account, and clone it down to start working on it!

## Commands to Remember:

### Starting up your project (after cloning)

```zsh
npm i
npm start
```
### Adding the "Styled Component" library
```zsh
npm install --save styled-components
```
More on Styled Components here: https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation

### Shutting down your project

In your node terminal in VSCode: `control + C`

### Saving your work 

```zsh
git add .
git commit -m "(Whatever message you want in here)"
git push
```

### More to Come... 

We will be adding more to this project, so please have the base of this project done by this Monday before class. Thanks!
